# What is this?

This is the nixie monorepo.  Monoepos are like, [so hot right now](http://giphy.com/gifs/zoolander-wJgksbFoieotG) -- all the cool kids are doing it, [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages), [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages), [Ember](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/tree/master/packages),
and [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages) do this.  Babel [explains most eloquently why](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md).
