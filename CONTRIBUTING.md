Sorry, I'm still feeling out this monorepo thing, so there are some rough edges -- plus, I'm still formulating my thoughts -- but I think the bones are good.  If you'd like to talk about something, submit an issue or a pull request, but please understand that pull requests won't be merged until I set up a testing target in the global private package -- I'll provide a more extensive contributing guide once the CI is set up for PRs.

In general, I've tried to make this as plugin-oriented as possible, which should make it easy to add a new target or platform without having merge conflicts to my other, faster-moving changes.  If you want to add a new platform, you'll want to add a: a [generator subcommand](http://yeoman.io/authoring/) (so we can generate your platform's distributable and a client for other platforms and targets to call it, if applicable), [eslint plugin rules](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-plugins.html) (to make sure any unsupported parts of your platforms' api aren't being used in author's source code), [browserify transform](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/wiki/list-of-transforms) (to make new apis from your platform available on other platforms), and a [shipit plugin](https://github.com/shipitjs/shipit#known-plugins).  Adding a target should be relatively easy as well -- for each platform you want to allow to use your platform, add it to the allowed values in the eslint nixierc plugin rules.  For either, you'll probably also want to add an example in `example-nixie`, though technically that's optional.
