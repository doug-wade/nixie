# nixie

`nixie` is a highly unopinionated, plugins-oriented platform built to distribute and run web apps, for values of web app that include all apps that are distributed over the web.  `nixie` that is especially valuable for quickly producing many apps that want to share a set of common components and/or target many platforms.  `nixie` is not tied to any framework; it should work equally well for teams that want to use gulp with angular and koa as for teams that want to use grunt with react and express or for teams that want to use brunch with polymer and hapi.

## How does nixie work?

`nixie` glues together a number of technologies that you already know through a very simple process.

`nixie` takes a yeoman generator and a gulp plugin to generate a web app for the appropriate target -- the roadmap includes cordova, web, and electron.  The yeoman generator generates a simple application that creates a safe place to start a node.js server, such as koa, express, or hapi.  Then, the application code is copied over the server
